<h3 class="caption">Broth and rice</h3>
<p>You may have noticed that this recipe has a question mark at the end thats because I don't know what its called. My boyfriend grew up making this Puerto Rican dish and introduced it to me. Problem is neither of us know what its called so we just call it the broth.</p>
<p>Even without a name this is a great dish for cold days or for when you don't feel like going to the store as most of the ingredients are pantry staples and can be substituted with many different items. </p>
